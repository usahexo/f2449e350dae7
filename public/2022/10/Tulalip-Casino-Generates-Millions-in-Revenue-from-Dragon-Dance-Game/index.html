<p>The Dragon Dance game is one of several new games that the casino has introduced in recent months. The casino also offers a variety of table games, slots, and progressives, as well as a Poker Room and Race &amp; Sports Book.</p>
<p>The Tulalip Casino is owned and operated by the Tulalip Tribes of Washington State. The tribe has more than 4,000 members and is one of the largest tribes in Washington. The casino employs more than 1,300 people and offers nearly 7,000 slot machines and table games.</p>
