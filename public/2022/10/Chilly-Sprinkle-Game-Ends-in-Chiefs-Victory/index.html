            <h1 id="Chilly-Sprinkle-Game-Ends-in-Chiefs-Victory"><a href="#Chilly-Sprinkle-Game-Ends-in-Chiefs-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Chilly Sprinkle Game Ends in Chiefs Victory"></a>Chilly Sprinkle Game Ends in Chiefs Victory</h1><p>A chilly sprinkle game that had Playoff implications for both the Chiefs and the Titans came to a close with a Kansas City victory. It was by no means easy, but they prevailed 27-24.</p>
<p>The Chiefs were able to jump out to an early 14-0 lead in the first quarter. Tennessee was not going down without a fight, however, and they rallied back to tie the game at 17-17 by halftime.</p>
<p>In the second half, it was all Chiefs. They scored 10 unanswered points to take a commanding 27-17 lead. The Titans managed to score one last touchdown with just over two minutes remaining in the game, but it was too little too late.</p>
<p>Kansas City’s win moves them into a three-way tie for first place in the AFC West with the Chargers and Raiders. They will look to continue their winning streak next week when they take on the Jets in New York.</p>
<h1 id="Peters-Smith-Shine-in-Wet-and-Windy-Victory-Over-the-Bengals"><a href="#Peters-Smith-Shine-in-Wet-and-Windy-Victory-Over-the-Bengals" class="headerlink" title="Peters, Smith Shine in Wet and Windy Victory Over the Bengals"></a>Peters, Smith Shine in Wet and Windy Victory Over the Bengals</h1><p>In a game that was wet and windy, QB Kirk Cousins completed 25 of his 30 passes for 365 yards and four touchdowns as the Redskins defeated the Bengals 38-21. TE Jordan Reed caught nine passes for 122 yards and two touchdowns, while WR Jamison Crowder caught seven passes for 108 yards and one touchdown. Meanwhile, RB Rob Kelley ran for 87 yards on 19 carries.</p>
<p>On defense, LB Preston Smith had five tackles, two sacks, and two forced fumbles, while CB Josh Norman had four tackles and one interception. The Redskins are now 5-3-1 on the season.</p>
<p>“It was a great team victory today,” said Cousins. “The offensive line did an excellent job protecting me in the wet conditions, and our receivers made some big plays.”</p>
<p>“It was great to see Jordan Reed have such a big game,” added Redskins head coach Jay Gruden. “He is a matchup nightmare for any team.”</p>
<h1 id="Chiefs-Hang-On-to-Win-Tight-Game-Against-the-Broncos"><a href="#Chiefs-Hang-On-to-Win-Tight-Game-Against-the-Broncos" class="headerlink" title="Chiefs Hang On to Win Tight Game Against the Broncos"></a>Chiefs Hang On to Win Tight Game Against the Broncos</h1><p>Last night, the Kansas City Chiefs were able to hold on to a win against the Denver Broncos, despite a late comeback attempt by the home team. This was an important game for both teams, as they are both currently in playoff contention.</p>
<p>The Chiefs took an early lead in the first quarter, with a touchdown pass from quarterback Alex Smith to wide receiver Tyreek Hill. The Broncos were able to score later in the quarter, however, tying the game at 7-7.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, the Chiefs were able to retake the lead, with a field goal and another touchdown pass from Smith to Hill. The Broncos were able to score again before halftime, making the score 20-14 in favor of Kansas City.</p>
<p>The third quarter was relatively uneventful, with both teams scoring just one field goal each. The Chiefs still held a six-point lead heading into the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, things started to heat up. The Broncos were able to score two touchdowns, taking a 28-27 lead with just under four minutes left in the game. However, the Chiefs were not done yet. They were able to tie the game with a touchdown and two-point conversion with under two minutes left. Then, after forcing a punt by Denver, they were able to score a field goal as time expired, winning 36-31.</p>
<p>This was an important win for the Chiefs, as it keeps them in playoff contention heading into the final weeks of the season. It was also an impressive comeback victory against a tough Broncos team.</p>
<h1 id="Hill-Leads-Chiefs-to-Comeback-Victory-in-Record-Setting-Fashion"><a href="#Hill-Leads-Chiefs-to-Comeback-Victory-in-Record-Setting-Fashion" class="headerlink" title="Hill Leads Chiefs to Comeback Victory in Record-Setting Fashion"></a>Hill Leads Chiefs to Comeback Victory in Record-Setting Fashion</h1><p>Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs offense were firing on all cylinders as they found themselves down by 28 points in the third quarter. However, quarterback Patrick Mahomes would lead the Chiefs on a record-setting comeback to win 45-44.</p>
<p>Mahomes was simply unstoppable in the second half, throwing for six touchdowns, including the game-winning score with under a minute remaining. The performance broke the NFL record for most touchdown passes in a single game.</p>
<p>The Chiefs now find themselves 2-0 and atop of the AFC West after back-to-back comeback victories. Next up is a matchup with the rival San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<h1 id="Mahomes-Chiefs-Thrash-Chargers-in-a-Wild-One"><a href="#Mahomes-Chiefs-Thrash-Chargers-in-a-Wild-One" class="headerlink" title="Mahomes, Chiefs Thrash Chargers in a Wild One"></a>Mahomes, Chiefs Thrash Chargers in a Wild One</h1><p>The Kansas City Chiefs and Patrick Mahomes had their way with the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday in a wild one. Mahomes finished with 284 yards and four touchdowns, three of which came in the first half.</p>
<p>Mahomes has now thrown for 14 touchdowns in just three games this season, breaking the NFL record for the most touchdown passes in the first three games of a season. He is also the first player in NFL history to throw 10 touchdown passes in the first two games of a season.</p>
<p>The Chiefs’ defense was also impressive, holding the Chargers to just 17 points. Tyreek Hill had another big day, catching six passes for 125 yards and two touchdowns. Hill now has six touchdown receptions through three games this season.</p>
<p>With Sunday’s win, the Chiefs move to 3-0 on the season and remain atop of the AFC West. The Chargers fall to 1-2 on the year.</p>
