<p>“I’m really excited about this game,” said Coen. “It’s something different than what’s out there and I think people are going to love it.”</p>
<p>The game is a baccarat variant that uses monkeys as the players. The object of the game is to get as close to nine as possible with your three monkeys. If you get too close to nine, you lose just like in regular baccarat.</p>
