He then moved on to become assistant coach of Werder Bremen in 2009. After a year as head coach of FC Augsburg’s reserve team, he became assistant coach of Hoffenheim in 2013. In late 2016, he left Hoffenheim to become Werder Bremen’s assistant coach once again.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-his-coaching-philosophy"><a href="#What-is-his-coaching-philosophy" class="headerlink" title="What is his coaching philosophy?"></a>What is his coaching philosophy?</h1><p>Nouri is known for his attacking style of play and his emphasis on youth development.

<h1 id="What-has-been-the-highlight-of-his-coaching-career-so-far"><a href="#What-has-been-the-highlight-of-his-coaching-career-so-far" class="headerlink" title="What has been the highlight of his coaching career so far?"></a>What has been the highlight of his coaching career so far?</h1><p> Winning the DFB-Pokal with Hoffenheim in 2016 was the highlight of Nouri’s coaching career thus far.</p>

He has won Bundesliga titles in each of his three seasons thus far and also led the club to a Champions League title in 2013. He also led Barcelona to multiple La Liga and Champions League trophies during his time there as head coach.</p>
<p>What is it about Guardiola’s coaching style that enables him to achieve such success? His teams are typically very well organized and he places a strong emphasis on possession football. This can be seen most clearly at Barcelona, where he molded the team into one of the most prolific passing sides in history.</p>
<p>Many experts feel that Guardiola is one of the best coaches in the world and his track record certainly backs up that claim. He has proved himself capable of winning major trophies with both Spanish and German clubs, which is a testament to his versatility and ability to adapt to different situations.</p>
