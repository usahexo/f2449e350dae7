#  What is the objective of Carnaval Forever?

Carnaval Forever is a free-to-play strategy game for mobile devices that challenges players to manage carnival attractions and keep visitors happy. It’s the first game of its kind, in which players must compete against other carnivals to become the most popular destination.

The objective of Carnaval Forever is to attract as many visitors as possible and keep them happy. To do this, players must build attractions and manage resources. Attractions can be leveled up by earning experience points, which can be obtained by completing tasks or upgrading buildings. Players can also customize their carnival with different decorations to make it stand out from the rest.

In order to keep visitors happy, players must ensure that they have enough food, drinks, and restrooms. If conditions get too crowded, visitors will start to leave unhappy, reducing the player’s overall score.

#  What are the bonus features in Carnaval Forever?

As a fan of street carnivals, I was excited to check out Carnaval Forever, a new carnival-themed game from Zynga. It didn't disappoint - the graphics are colorful and eye-catching, and the gameplay is fun and engaging. But what are the bonus features in Carnaval Forever?

First, there's the bonus wheel. You can spin it once a day for a chance to win coins, boosts, and other prizes. Second, there are the quests. These provide another way to earn coins and rewards, and they're a fun way to explore the game world. Third, there are the characters. Each character has her own unique set of abilities, which can be helpful in completing quests. Finally, there's the social aspect. You can visit your friends' carnivals to help them out (and earn rewards in return), or just chat with them about the game.

Overall, Carnaval Forever is an enjoyable and addictive game with plenty of bonus features to keep you coming back for more. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Zynga comes up with for this game!
