#  Moldova may become the new Monaco—a playground for the rich and famous!

If you had to choose a country in Europe that’s poised to become the next Monaco, you might pick Moldova. This small, landlocked country in Eastern Europe has been making headlines recently with its efforts to attract foreign investment and create a haven for the wealthy.

Moldova may be off the radar for many travelers, but it’s definitely worth a visit. The country is home to some beautiful landscapes, including rolling hills and peaceful villages, and there are plenty of interesting attractions to explore. What’s more, Moldova is surprisingly affordable, making it an ideal destination for budget-conscious travelers.

While Moldova has long been considered a poor country, things are starting to change. The government is making a concerted effort to court foreign investors and make the country more attractive to tourists. In particular, they are targeting the Russian market—a move that seems to be paying off.

In recent years, there has been a surge in Russian investment in Moldova, thanks in part to the weak ruble. This has helped boost the Moldovan economy and led to a construction boom, with new hotels and restaurants popping up all over the country.

What does this mean for travelers? Simply put, now is an excellent time to visit Moldova! The country is still relatively undiscovered, meaning that you can enjoy all of its charms without having to deal with crowds of tourists. And with the economy growing at a healthy rate, prices are only going to get more affordable in the years ahead.

So what are you waiting for? Plan your trip to Moldova today!

#  South Bend casino to open in Moldova—will it be a success?

	In what is being called a “historic moment for Moldova,” the first casino in the Eastern European country is set to open its doors next month. The $50 million South Bend Casino and Resort is located in the town of Orhei, about 35 miles north of the capital city of Chisinau.


The casino has been years in the making, with developers touting it as a major tourist attraction that will bring much-needed revenue to the cash-strapped country. But will it be a success?


Moldova is one of Europe’s poorest countries, and its economy has been battered by political instability and isolation from its neighbors. The average monthly salary in Moldova is just over $400, compared to more than $4,000 in neighboring Romania. Nearly one-third of the population lives below the poverty line.


The casinos in neighboring Romania have had mixed results, with some doing quite well while others are struggling. It remains to be seen whether Moldovans will gamble their hard-earned money away in a casino. There is also some concern that the casino will attract crime and prostitution to the area.


Nonetheless, developers are optimistic that the Orhei casino will be a big draw for tourists. The complex will include a hotel with 250 rooms, restaurants, bars, and a spa. There will also be an entertainment center with a movie theater and ballroom. The casino will offer slot machines, poker tables, and blackjack tables.


Moldova is hoping that the casino will help boost its economy and bring in much-needed revenue. Only time will tell if this gamble will pay off!

#  4 Winds casino set to open in Moldova next month

After almost two years of construction, the 4 Winds casino is set to open next month in Chisinau, Moldova. The new casino will be the first of its kind in the country and is expected to bring in much needed revenue to the struggling economy.

The 4 Winds casino is a $50 million project that is expected to create 1,000 jobs. It will be operated by Austrian company Casinos Austria International and will offer a range of gaming options, including blackjack, roulette, and poker. There will also be a spa, a fitness center, and a number of restaurants.

Moldova has been struggling economically in recent years due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The country's GDP has shrunk by over 20% since 2013 and unemployment is now at over 20%. The government is hoping that the 4 Winds casino can help boost the economy and create jobs.

Casinos are seen as a major draw for tourists and can generate significant revenue for a country. In 2015, Macau's casinos generated over $30 billion in revenue, accounting for more than 60% of the country's GDP. Casino revenues have been declining in recent years due to increased competition from other countries such as Singapore and Australia, but they are still seen as an important source of income for many countries.

The opening of the 4 Winds casino next month is just the latest sign that Moldova is keen to promote tourism and attract investment from abroad. Last year, the government passed a law making it easier for foreign investors to do business in Moldova and earlier this year it launched a new visa program aimed at attracting more tourists.

#  4 Winds International opens casino in Moldova

4 Winds International, the leading casino operator in the Baltics, has announced that it has opened a new casino in Chisinau, Moldova.

The new 4 Winds casino is housed in the world-class Radisson Blu hotel and offers over 50 exciting table games and over 1,000 slots and video poker machines.

Commenting on the opening, 4 Winds CEO Einari Pajula said: "4 Winds is delighted to add Chisinau and Moldova to our growing list of destinations. The new casino is spectacular and offers something for everyone - from beginners to seasoned veterans."

4 Winds International is well known for its professional and friendly staff, who are always happy to help players learn the ropes or advance their skills. In addition to its world-class facilities, the company also offers generous bonuses and promotions, ensuring that players always enjoy good value for money.

#  4 Winds expanding into Moldova with new casino

4 Winds, a multinational casino operator, is expanding into Moldova with the launch of a new venue in the capital, Chisinau.

The new 4 Winds Casino will feature over 100 gaming tables and 1,000 slot machines, as well as a range of restaurants and bars. It is hoped that the new casino will attract high rollers from across Europe and help to boost tourism in Moldova.

Moldova has long been seen as a potential gaming destination, with its mix of casinos, bars and nightlife. However, until now there has been no large-scale international casino operator in the country.

4 Winds is hoping to change that with its new casino in Chisinau. The company already operates casinos in Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia, and it sees Moldova as a key market for growth.

Casino gambling is booming in Eastern Europe, with revenues reaching $10 billion last year. 4 Winds plans to capitalize on this growth by expanding its operations in the region.

The new 4 Winds Casino in Chisinau is scheduled to open in October 2018.
