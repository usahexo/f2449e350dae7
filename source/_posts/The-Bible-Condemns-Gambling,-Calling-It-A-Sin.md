#  The Bible Condemns Gambling, Calling It A Sin

Gambling is condemned throughout the Bible, with verses referring to it as a sin. It's classified as a sin because it involves taking risks with what you own in the hope of gaining more, which goes against the biblical principle of being content with what you have.

Gambling can also lead to greed, obsession with money, and other destructive behaviours. It can tear families and friendships apart, and cause financial ruin. In short, gambling is a very harmful activity that should be avoided at all costs.

#  Proverbs 28:22: A stingy man is eager to get rich and does not know that poverty awaits him.3. Luke 16:10-13: Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. So if you have not been faithful in handling earthly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? And if you have not been faithful with someone else's property, who will give you your own?

There are many different types of wealth in this world. Money, property, possessions, and so on. But one of the most valuable types of wealth is trust. Trust is something that is earned, and once it is lost, it can be very difficult to regain.

The Bible has a lot to say about trust. In fact, the book of Proverbs has a whole chapter devoted to the topic. Proverbs 28:22 says, "A stingy man is eager to get rich and does not know that poverty awaits him." In other words, if you're not careful, being greedy will lead to ruin.

This same principle is also found in the New Testament book of Luke. In Luke 16:10-13, Jesus says, "Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. So if you have not been faithful in handling earthly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? And if you have not been faithful with someone else's property, who will give you your own?"

In other words, if you're not trustworthy with what you have now, how can you be trusted with more? It's a good question to ask yourself. Are you frugal and careful with your money? Are you honest in your business dealings? If not, then you may find it difficult to amass greater wealth in the future.

On the other hand, if you are trustworthy with what God has given you already, He will trust you with even more. So be faithful today with what God has given you and trust Him for tomorrow.

# 4. 1 Timothy 6:9-10: But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.5. Gambling Is A Sin – God Will Punish Those Who Gamble

The Bible is clear that gambling is a sin. In 1 Timothy 6:9-10, it says that those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

Gambling can lead to addiction, financial disaster, and even criminal activity. It’s not worth the risk – especially when you consider that God will punish those who gamble. In Proverbs 28:22 it says, “He who hastens to be rich hath an evil eye, and considers not that poverty shall come upon him.”

Don’t let gambling ruin your life – choose instead to obey God’s commands.
